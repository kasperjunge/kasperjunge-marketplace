# Clarify Requirements
Helps clarify project requirements by asking focused questions and documenting user needs.

## Initial Setup
Respond with:
```
I'm ready to help clarify your project requirements.

Please describe what you want to build.
```

Wait for user input.

## Workflow
1. **Receive user's project description**
2. **Ask clarifying questions** (3-5 at a time) about:
   - User needs and goals
   - Key scenarios and use cases
   - Edge cases and error handling
   - Scope boundaries (what's in/out)
   - Success criteria
3. **Continue asking** until no more questions remain
4. **Generate requirements document** at `spec/requirements.md`

## Guidelines
- Each bullet with a clarifying question should be numbered
- Stay user-focused: describe WHAT users need, not HOW to build it
- No tech stack, architecture, or implementation details
- Be specific: acceptance criteria should be testable
- Avoid vague terms like "user-friendly" or "fast"
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Use "Out of Scope" section aggressively
- Every feature should map to a clear user need

## Chat Output Format
After completing requirements:
```
I've created a requirements document at spec/requirements.md.

The document includes:
- [X] user stories with acceptance criteria
- [X] functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Clear scope boundaries

Please review and let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
```

## File Output Format
Create `spec/requirements.md`:

```markdown
# Requirements: [Project Name]

## Project Overview
[2-3 sentences describing what this project is and why it exists]

## Target Users
[Who will use this? What's their context and needs?]

## User Stories

### Story 1: [User Goal]
**As a** [type of user]  
**I want to** [action]  
**So that** [benefit/value]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 2]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 3]

**Edge Cases:**
- [What happens when X?]
- [What happens when Y?]

### Story 2: [Another User Goal]
[Same structure as Story 1]

[Continue for all major user stories]

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: [Requirement Name]
**Description**: [What the system must do]  
**Priority**: High/Medium/Low  
**Acceptance**: [How to verify this works]

### FR2: [Another Requirement]
[Same structure]

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- [e.g., "Page load time under 2 seconds"]
- [e.g., "Support up to 1000 items"]

### Usability
- [e.g., "Interface should be intuitive for first-time users"]
- [e.g., "Key actions accessible within 2 clicks"]

### Accessibility
- [Any accessibility requirements if applicable]

## Out of Scope
[Explicitly list what we're NOT building to prevent scope creep]
- [Feature/functionality 1]
- [Feature/functionality 2]

## Success Criteria
[How do we know this project succeeded?]
- [ ] [Measurable success criterion 1]
- [ ] [Measurable success criterion 2]

## Open Questions
[Any remaining uncertainties - resolve these before design phase]
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]
